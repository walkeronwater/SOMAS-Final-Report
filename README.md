# SOMAS Final Report Guidelines

The following are the guidelines for the SOMAS final report. 

- All commits must be reviewed by someone in the core design and infra rep teams
- All *editors* will be added as owners of the repository and will be able to review and approve pull requests. (anyone who wants to be an editor/owner message Yannis on discord)
- No additional members will be approved to approve commits but anyone is welcome to submit a pull request to the document
- The project is set up to work with whichever editor you choose (Overleaf, etc)
- You should NOT approve your own pull requests. This is really bad practice and writing should be reviewed by another design or infra rep to prevent the inconsistencies and issues in the first doc.
- All commits should be made to a separate branch and merged to master via a pull request (PR).

## Writing Instructions

Editors should review the writing firstmost for correctness and consistency with the rest of the document and secondly for spelling, grammar and punctuation.

As another reminder, please remember that something done is better than something perfect. Something perfect never gets done. This means that it is better to iteratively work on your sections and build up to something great rather than get caught up in the details from the start.
